# Simpplr-Content---Find-and-Replace

##TODO
*Add code and instructions to replace text in a tile.

# What does this do?

The code will allow you to upload a JSON obtained by Salesforce Inspector for the Salesforce package, Simpplr. It accepts a string such as a domain name and will find and replace your search string. The output will only contain Simpplr Content that was changed.

# Why was this created?

This code was written for fun. I wanted to write a script that only outputs content that was modified and output the number of content that was changed.
